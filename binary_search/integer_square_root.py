"""
Write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns
the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to
the integer given.
Example:
    Assume input is integer 300.
    Then the expected output of the function should be
    17, since 17^2 = 289 < 300. Note that 18^2 = 324 > 300,
    so the number 17 is the correct response.
