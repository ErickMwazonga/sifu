"""
Define a bitonic sequence as a sequence of integers such that:
    x_1 < ... < x_k > ... > x_n-1 for some k, 0 <= k < n.
For example:
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
is a bitonic sequence. Write a program to find the largest element in such a
sequence. In the example above, the program should return "5".
We assume that such a "peak" element exists.
