162. Find Peak Element
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

Given a non-empty array of integers arr, create a function that returns the index of a peak element.
We consider an element as peak if it's greater than or equal to its neighbors,
the next and previous element (assume that arr[-1] and arr[n] are equal to -âˆž).
And if there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.

Input: arr = [4, 5, 8, 3] -> 2
    Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[1], and greater than or equal to arr[3]
Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8] -> 4
    Explanation: arr[4] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[3], which is it's only neighbor
Input: arr = [1, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3] -> 3
    Explanation: arr[3] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal
    to arr[2] and greater than or equal to arr[4] (other valid outputs would be 1 and 4, because arr[1] and arr[4] are also peak elements)
