503. Next Greater Element II
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), 
return the next greater number for every element in nums.
The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, 
which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

Example 1:
1. [1, 2, 1] -> [2, -1, 2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
