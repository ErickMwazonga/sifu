973. K Closest Points to Origin
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
