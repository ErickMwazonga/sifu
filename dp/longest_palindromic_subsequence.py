516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by 
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 

Examples:
1. 'bbbab' -> 4
2. 'cbbd' -> 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is 'bb'.
