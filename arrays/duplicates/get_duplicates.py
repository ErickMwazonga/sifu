"""
Imagine you have a list in memory of length n.
The elements of the list are drawn from the set of integers between [1,n-1].
So, youâ€™re guaranteed to have at least one duplicate in the list.
You have to write a function that prints out a duplicate in the list.

Valid:
    [1,2,1] -> 1
    [3,3,3,3,3,3] -> 3
    [1,2,1,2] -> 1,2

Invalid:
    [1]
    [1,2]
