Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), 
find the minimum number of conference rooms required.)

NB: (0, 8), (8, 10) is not conflict at 8

Example1
Input: intervals = [(0, 30), (5, 10), (15, 20)]
Output: 2

Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0, 30)
room2: (5, 10), (15, 20)
