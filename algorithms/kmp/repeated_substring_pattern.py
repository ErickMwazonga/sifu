'''
459. Repeated Substring Pattern
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/
Resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lumwBLJOQpk

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of
it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

Examples:
1. 'abab' -> True
    Explanation: It is the substring 'ab' twice.
2. 'aba' -> False
3. 'abcabcabcabc' -> True
    Explanation: It is the substring 'abc' four times or the substring 'abcabc' twice.
